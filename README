crckt is a quick and dirty monte carlo which contains absolutely no
physics whatsoever, guaranteed.  it simply generates a series of chirps,
in the radar sense, and writes them to data.  

your end of the bargain:
specify an event rate, a center frequency, a bandwidth, a time of
flight, a sample rate, and a signal to noise ratio.

crckt end of the bargain:
a simulated poisson process, where an event corresponds to a chirp.  
CHIPS ARE ALLOWED TO OVERLAP.  gaussian white noise is also added to the
signal, in such a way that the S/N ratio for a single chirp (i.e. one
with no pileup) is what you specify.
